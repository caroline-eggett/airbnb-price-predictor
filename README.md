# Airbnb Predictive Analytics

**Goal**: Describe your final machine-learning product and assess its performance in the context of your intended audience. Discuss the inputs to the model and your training process. Evaluate the performance of the model both objectively and according to the perspective of potential users.

### Components:

1. Briefly summarize the purpose of your machine-learning model. The summary should describe the relevant audience and decisions as well as the outputs of the model.

2. Describe the inputs to the model. What are the instances and features? What are the sources of the data?

3. Discuss your training process. What models did you evaluate? How did you approach feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization? What metrics did you use to evaluate models?

4. Describe your final model. How well does the model perform according to appropriate metrics?

5. Evaluate the model through the eyes of your intended audience.
   – How well does the model solve your audience’s problem?
   – How legible is the output of the model for your audience?
   – What might your users think are the strengths and weaknesses
   of the model?
   – What additional work would be necessary for creating a viable
   product?

   **Notes:**

   - #1 should have already been done
   - #2 should have already been done
   - #3: We mentioned we wanted to do an ensemble method with linear regression (lasso regularization), decision tree, and random forest. We will take the average price for those three models AND then add a 5% increase to the price so that Airbnb would get money, along with adhereing to inflation.
