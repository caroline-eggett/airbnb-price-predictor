# Notes

### Introduce the problem your team will develop a machine-learning model to address. Be sure to address the following questions.

- Jonah will write the target audience, decisions, outputs of the model, what type of model.

### Introduce the data the team will use to train your machine-learning model. Provide a descriptive analyses of the data, and interpret the result of each descriptive analysis. Discuss relevant assumptions about the data, including those regarding how the source collected the data. Describe potential costs of collecting the data in practice.

- Caroline and Michael will do the descriptive analytics
- Relevant Assumptions of the data collection: price was taken at one point in time--it can easily change, data was from a database--there could be users that have never had someone stay in a place, but are still included with the price.
- Relevant Assumptions of the data: median age is the same across cities in the same state, the price is not changing in 2022 due to inflation, the median income is the same across households
- Costs in collecting data: median age and income from a Census (cost to survey people), Airbnb data doesn't have a high cost because they have a database

### Define the features that your group expects to be most important for model development. Explain how the variables relate to the important aspects of the context (e.g., the variables may be proxies for something that is not observable).

- Carter define the features and interpret the results.

- Abstract
- Descriptive Analytics
- Interpretation
  - Appears that the median price is $147.00. We have outliers in the data, therefore we intend to exclude from the feature modeling porportion of the analysis.
  - The majority of the rooms are entire homes and apartments, with some presence of private rooms as listings.
  - Hotel Rooms, being the smallest subset group, appear to have the largest average room price.
  - The top three cities (the cities with the most listings in our data) are NYC, LA, and Hawaii
  - The average prices of these cities are X, Y, Z
- Conclusion
